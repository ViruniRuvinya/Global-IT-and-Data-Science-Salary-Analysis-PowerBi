## Data Source
The data for this project is obtained from the Kaggle dataset: ([latest-data-science-job-salaries-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/latest-data-science-job-salaries-2024)) . This dataset is assumed to contain information on job titles, salaries, countries, and potentially other relevant factors like experience, education level, and gender.

## Tools and Technologies
This project is implemented using Microsoft Power BI. Power BI is a business intelligence tool that allows for data visualization and interactive dashboards.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

-**Analyze salary trends:** Identify average salaries for IT and Data Science jobs in different countries (Canada, USA, UK, Australia, and China based on the chosen dataset).
Compare salaries across countries: See how salaries vary for the same job title across different countries.

-**Explore demographics**: Investigate the distribution of genders and age groups within the dataset.
Uncover job title impact: Identify how job titles within IT and Data Science fields influence salary ranges.

-**Visualize insights:** Present the findings through interactive charts and tables within a Power BI dashboard.

## Project Deliverables
The key deliverable of this project is a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into the following aspects:

-**Average Salary by Country:** This visualization will show the average salary for IT and Data Science jobs in each of the included countries.

-**Count of Gender:** This chart will display the distribution of genders within the dataset.

-**Count of Country by Age and Country:** This table will break down the number of individuals by age group within each country.

-**Average Salary by Job Title:** This chart will showcase the average salary for each unique IT and Data Science job title.

-**Average Education Level by Job Title and Country:** This table will potentially reveal the average education level for each job title within each country.

## Target Audience
This project can benefit the following audiences:

-**IT Professionals and Data Scientists**: Gain insights into salary trends across different countries and job titles within their field.

-**Job Seekers**: Understand potential salary ranges for IT and Data Science jobs in their desired countries.

## Project Limitations
It's important to consider these limitations:

Data Representativeness: The chosen dataset might not comprehensively reflect the entire IT and Data Science job market.

Salary Averages: The visualizations present average salaries, which may not represent the actual salary of any specific individual.
